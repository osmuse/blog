Hey there. Welcome to my blog. I plan on posting Hack The Box and TryHackMe tutorials. I will probably include some random posts about Cybersecurity or other things as well.

So, a little about me. My name is Eric Osmus. I work in Cybersecurity for an Oil and Gas company.  I mainly do blue team like incident response and vulnerability management. However, red team is really intriguing so that is why most of my posts will be centered around that.

Hope you enjoy the blog. Any feedback is appreciated. Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/e_osmus) if you have any.
